Supply Chain Analytics & Forecasting Project — Python, Pandas, Plotly, Scikit-Learn
- • Analyzed a multi-variable supply chain dataset (24 features across products, logistics, manufacturing, and transportation) to identify operational inefficiencies and cost drivers.
- • Cleaned, transformed, and engineered features using Python; standardized categorical variables, corrected schema, removed duplicates, and prepared modeling-ready datasets.
- • Performed KPI-driven EDA using correlation matrices, pairplots, and segmented group analysis (routes, transportation modes, product categories, customer demographics).
- • Identified high-cost shipping routes, slow transportation modes, and low-stock SKUs through aggregated revenue, order quantity, cost, and lead-time analysis.
- • Built regression models to forecast stock levels and transportation costs; applied OLS to determine statistically significant predictors (lead times, location, order quantities).
- • Visualized insights using Matplotlib and Plotly, producing dashboard-style charts for route efficiency, customer segmentation, and product-wise performance.
-
- • Delivered actionable insights to optimize inventory levels, reduce logistics costs, and improve route selection—aligning with supply-chain BI decision-making workflows.
