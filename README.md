# Supply Chain Analytics & Forecasting Project
**Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Plotly, Scikit-Learn

## Project Overview
Analyzed a multi-variable supply chain dataset (24 features across products, logistics, manufacturing, and transportation) to identify operational inefficiencies and cost drivers. Delivered actionable insights to optimize inventory, reduce logistics costs, and improve route selection.

## Key Contributions
- **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:**  
  Cleaned, transformed, and engineered features using Python. Standardized categorical variables, corrected schema inconsistencies, removed duplicates, and prepared modeling-ready datasets.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Performed KPI-driven analysis using correlation matrices, pairplots, and segmented group analysis by routes, transportation modes, product categories, and customer demographics.

- **Cost & Performance Analysis:**  
  Identified high-cost shipping routes, slow transportation modes, and low-stock SKUs through aggregated revenue, order quantity, cost, and lead-time analysis.

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Built regression models to forecast stock levels and transportation costs. Applied OLS regression to determine statistically significant predictors, including lead times, location, and order quantities.

- **Data Visualization:**  
  Created dashboard-style visualizations using Matplotlib and Plotly, highlighting route efficiency, customer segmentation, and product-wise performance.

- **Business Impact:**  
  Delivered actionable insights that align with supply chain BI decision-making workflows, enabling optimization of inventory levels, cost reduction, and improved transportation planning.

## Project Outcome
- Optimized inventory management and stock forecasting  
- Reduced logistics and transportation costs  
- Streamlined route planning and operational efficiency
